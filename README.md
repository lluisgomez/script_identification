# Scene Text Script Identification

This code repository contains the implementation of Script Identification methods proposed in the following papers:

1. "A fine-grained approach to scene text script identification" (Gomez & Karatzas) to appear in DAS 2016 workshop proceedings

2. "Boosting patch-based scene text script identification with ensembles of conjoined networks" (Gomez, Nicolaou, and Karatzas) 2016 pre-rpint


Each code project is selfcontained in its own directory (1) **UFL/** and (2) **ECN/**, and is totally independent of the other. They share a common github repository just because (2) is an evolution of (1). 

See the README files on each directory for specific instructions on compiling/using this code.


Please, if you make use of any of this projects, we appreciate it if you cite the respective paper(s):
